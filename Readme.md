# WellWheel

WellWheel is a web-based application designed to provide emergency ambulance booking services for users. It is structured to cater to three primary interfaces: User, Driver, and Hospital. The User interface allows individuals to quickly book an ambulance during an emergency, while the Driver interface enables drivers to accept bookings and navigate to the user's location. The Hospital interface helps hospitals manage incoming ambulance requests and coordinate patient transfers. Built using the MERN stack, the app utilizes EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for rendering dynamic content, providing a seamless experience for all users involved. 

It offers three main interfaces:

1. User Interface: Allows users to quickly book an ambulance during emergencies, track its real-time location, and receive updates.

2. Driver Interface: Enables ambulance drivers to accept booking requests, navigate to the user's location, and manage their availability.

3. Hospital Interface: Lets hospitals manage incoming ambulance requests, coordinate patient transfers, and receive real-time updates.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and EJS for server-side rendering, WellWheel ensures smooth operations with features like real-time communication, notifications. It is designed to provide timely and reliable emergency medical services with ease.
